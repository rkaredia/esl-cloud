Setup Instruction

Phase 1: The Setup (5 Minutes)

You need three things: Homebrew (the Mac package manager), Python, and VS Code.

    Open your Terminal (Command + Space, type "Terminal").

    Install Homebrew (if you don't have it): /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

    Install Python: brew install python

    Verify: python3 --version (You should see something like Python 3.12+)

Phase 2: Setup project

# 1. Create a folder for your business
mkdir esl_platform && cd esl_platform

# 2. Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# 3. Activate it
source venv/bin/activate
# (Your terminal prompt should now show (venv) at the start)

# 4. Install Django
pip install django


Phase 3: Build the Application Structure

Now we generate the scaffolding.
Bash

# 1. Start the main project
django-admin startproject esl_cloud .

# 2. Create the "Core" app where your tags and products live
python manage.py startapp core


3. Let's Build the Image Generator

Now that your database is organized, we can move to the "low maintenance" magic: Auto-generating the label images.

First, you need to install the Pillow library (the modern version of PIL) on your Mac:

    Stop your server (Control + C).

    Run: pip install pillow

    Start your server: python manage.py runserver

The "Label Maker" Script

Create a new file called core/utils.py. This script will create a simple Black and White image for your tags.



Prerequisites

You need to install the barcode library in your terminal:
Bash

pip install python-barcode

You also need a .ttf font file. On your Mac, you can find many in /Library/Fonts/ (e.g., Arial Bold.ttf). Copy one into a new folder in your project called core/static/fonts/.
