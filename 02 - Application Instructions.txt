Phase 4: Implementation (The Schema)

Open your project folder in VS Code. We need to tell Django about the models we designed earlier.

    Open esl_cloud/settings.py and add 'core', to the INSTALLED_APPS list.

    Open core/models.py and paste the schema I gave you in the previous message.

    A Note for the Data Engineer: Django defaults to SQLite for local development. It's a single file database that requires zero setup. For your MVP, this is perfect. You can swap to PostgreSQL in 2 minutes later just by changing 5 lines in settings.py.

Phase 5: Migrations & The Admin Panel

This is the part where Django builds the actual database tables based on your Python code.
Bash

# 1. Prepare the database instructions
python manage.py makemigrations core

# 2. Execute and build the tables
python manage.py migrate

# 3. Create your "Super User" (The God-level login)
python manage.py createsuperuser
# (Follow the prompts to set a username/password)

Phase 6: Start "Clicking Around"

Run the server: python manage.py runserver

Now, open your browser and go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin

Why this is cool: Django has a built-in "Admin" interface. Once you register your models in core/admin.py, you will see a fully functional GUI where you can manually add Companies, Stores, and Tags to test your logic before you even write a single line of HTML.

--------
The "Data Engineer" Reset

Because you just changed the core identity of the database while migrations were halfway in flight, the easiest way to ensure a clean state (since we have no real data yet) is a quick "wipe and restart" of the local DB:

    Delete the database file: In your terminal, run: rm db.sqlite3

    Delete the failed migration file: Go into your core/migrations/ folder and delete any files that start with 0001_.... Do not delete __init__.py.

    Run migrations again:
    Bash

    python manage.py makemigrations core
    python manage.py migrate
