Your New Workflow

Whenever we finish a chunk of code today (like the Image Scaling logic), follow this "Rule of Three":

    git add .: Tell Git "I want to save these new changes."

    git commit -m "Added image scaling logic": Create the local baseline with a descriptive note.

    git push: Update the baseline on GitHub.
